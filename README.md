Password Strength Evaluator & Generator:
This Python project provides a simple yet effective tool for evaluating password strength, improving weak passwords, and generating secure passwords. It‚Äôs ideal for personal use, educational projects, or as a utility in larger applications requiring password validation.
---
Features:
- Strength Evaluation: Checks if a password meets security standards (length, character diversity).
- Password Improvement: Enhances weak passwords by adding missing character types and extending length.
- Secure Generation: Creates strong, randomized passwords with customizable length.
---
 How It Works:
The script uses Python‚Äôs built-in string and random libraries to analyze and manipulate passwords. It ensures that a strong password includes:
- At least 8 characters  
- Lowercase letters  
- Uppercase letters  
- Digits  
- Special symbols
---
Requirements:
No external dependencies required.  
Built entirely with Python‚Äôs standard library.
---
- If you already have a password, the script will evaluate its strength and offer an improved version if needed.
- If you don‚Äôt have a password, it will generate a secure one for you. 
---
Example Output:
Do you already have a password? (yes/no): yes
Enter your password: abc123
‚ùå Your password is weak. Here's a stronger version based on it:
üîê Improved password: aB3$abc1!
